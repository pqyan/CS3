               <h1>Avatar The Last Airbender</h1>
               <p>The Four Nations (Air, Fire, Water, Earth) lived together in harmony until the Fire nation attacked and declared war. 
                  Only the avatar, a person who could control the four elements, was the only one who could stop them. But when the world was in need of the Avatar, he disappeared. 
                  A century passed, and a Southern Water tribe bender named Katara and her brother discovered the new avatar: Aang, from the air nation. He was a master in the Aitr element, but could he learn the others and stop the Fire Nation in a short period of time?</p>
